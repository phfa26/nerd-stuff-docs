# Welcome to Day 2

Today, we'll dive into essential tools and methodologies that are used every day by software engineers around the world.

## Today's Agenda

- **The Software Engineer toolbelt**
- **Version Control**
- **Git and Github**
- **Agile Methodologies and Cerymonies**
- **Jira**

## The Software Engineer's Toolbelt

### IDE and Browser Dev Tools
- **Overview:** Discuss the crucial software and tools every developer should be familiar with. Emphasis on the role of IDEs and text editors in speeding up development and improving efficiency.
- **Activities:** 
    - Demonstrate isetting up Visual Studio Code, followed by configuring essential plugins.
    - Understanding Google Crhome DevTools

### Version Control

- **Overview:**  Understanding the importance of version control.

## Git and GitHub

- **Git Basics:** Introduction to version control concepts with Git. Cover `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`.
- **Collaborating on GitHub:** Walkthrough on creating a GitHub repository, cloning it, making changes, and pushing updates. Include pull requests and merging.
- **Hands-on Exercise:** Students will fork a repo, clone it, make changes, and submit a pull request.

### Agile Methodologies and Ceremonies

- **Agile Overview:** 
Agile is a project management methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction in software development. It involves iterative processes, where projects are divided into small, manageable segments allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans. This approach encourages teamwork, constant feedback, and the ability to respond quickly to changes, aiming to deliver high-quality products that meet users' needs in a timely manner.

- **Key Ceremonies:** 
    - Sprint Planning
    - Daily Stand-Up
    - Sprint Review
    - Sprint Retrospective

There are variations of these ceremonies and every team have the liberty implement these or other ceremonies as needed.
Eg.: "Daily/Weekly Engineering Catchup"

- **Practical Application:** Break into small groups to conduct a mock sprint planning session. (time permitting - we will come back to this in the future)

### Jira

- Introduction to Jira as a tool for Agile project management.
- Navigating Jira's interface: Boards, backlogs, sprints, and issues.
- Practical exercise: Creating a sprint and managing tasks in Jira. (time permitting - we will come back to this in the future)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** Introduction to VS Code as a powerful IDE for software development.
- Checking the installation and setup of VS Code (homework from day 1).
- Overview of key features and extensions beneficial for new developers.

### Writing Our First "Hello World" in JavaScript

- **Introduction to JavaScript:**  Fundamental language in web development.
- **Node.js:** Essential for running JavaScript outside the browser (installation completed as homework from day 1).

## Writing Our First "Hello World" in JavaScript
- **Coding Exercise:** Write a "Hello World" script in JavaScript.
  ```javascript
  // helloWorld.js
  console.log('Hello, world!');
  ```

- **Running Our Script:** Demonstrate how to run the script in VS Code's integrated terminal after installing Node.js.
  ```bash
  node helloWorld.js
  ```

**Homework:**
- Create a new GitHub repository and add your newly created code there.
- Clone and add a contribution to the code of one or more classmates.
